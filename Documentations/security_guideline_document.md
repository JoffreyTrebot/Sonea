# Implementation Plan for iOS Relaxing App

This implementation plan outlines phases, milestones, deliverables, and security considerations for the Relaxing App. It follows MVVM with SwiftUI, integrates Supabase backend, AVAudioEngine for audio, and adheres to secure-by-design principles.

---

## Phase 0: Inception & Architecture (1 week)

### Goals
- Define detailed requirements and user flows
- Design high-level architecture diagrams (MVVM layers, services)
- Establish coding standards, branching strategy, CI/CD pipeline
- Setup Supabase project with secure defaults

### Deliverables
- Functional spec and UI wireframes
- Architecture document (components, data flow)
- Project repo initialized with SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, fastlane
- CI pipeline: unit tests, linting, SCA (Dependency vulnerability scan)

### Security Tasks
- Enforce HTTPS only in network layer
- Configure Supabase with least-privilege database roles
- Store secrets in Keychain or CI secrets manager (no hard-coded keys)

---

## Phase 1: Authentication & User Management (2 weeks)

### Features
- Email/password signup & login via Supabase
- Apple Sign-In integration
- Secure session management (token storage, refresh)
- Logout and session invalidation

### Deliverables
- `AuthService` (async/await) with unit tests
- SwiftUI screens: Sign In, Sign Up, Password Reset
- Role-based access scaffolding (user profiles)

### Security Tasks
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Hash tokens securely in Keychain
- Enforce strong password policy on client and server
- Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints via Supabase policies

---

## Phase 2: Audio Service & Streaming Playback (2 weeks)

### Features
- Fetch sound catalog metadata from Supabase Storage
- Stream audio tracks with AVAudioEngine loops
- Implement fade-in/fade-out transitions

### Deliverables
- `AudioEngineService` module with track management API
- SwiftUI list/grid of sounds with thumbnail and download indicator
- Unit tests and basic integration tests for streaming

### Security Tasks
- Sanitize metadata before display to prevent injection
- Enforce TLS for all storage requests
- Restrict CORS on Supabase Storage to app bundle ID

---

## Phase 3: Mixer UI & Custom Mix Persistence (2 weeks)

### Features
- Multi-track mixer interface with independent volume sliders
- Real-time volume adjustments on AVAudioEngine
- Save/load mixes to PostgreSQL (Supabase)

### Deliverables
- `MixerView` and `MixerViewModel` in SwiftUI
- API endpoints for CRUD operations on mixes
- Data models and offline caching for mixes

### Security Tasks
- Validate mix names (length, character whitelist)
- Use parameterized queries for mix persistence
- Implement server-side RBAC checks for mix operations

---

## Phase 4: Offline Download & Cache Management (1.5 weeks)

### Features
- Download audio files into Application Support directory
- LRU cache with file size limit and automatic purging
- UI indicators for download status and delete action

### Deliverables
- `DownloadService` handling file I/O, integrity checks
- Settings toggle for auto-purge
- Unit tests for cache eviction logic

### Security Tasks
- Validate file paths to prevent path traversal
- Set file permissions to owner-only
- Scan metadata for viruses if possible (future enhancement)

---

## Phase 5: Playback Controls & Sleep Timer (1 week)

### Features
- Background audio playback support
- User-configurable timer with fade-out and local notification

### Deliverables
- Integration with AVAudioSession for background mode
- `TimerService` with local notifications
- SwiftUI UI for timer controls

### Security Tasks
- Request only necessary background modes
- Sanitize notification content
- Fail gracefully if permission denied

---

## Phase 6: Settings & Localization (1 week)

### Features
- Light/dark mode support
- Default timer duration, auto-delete toggle
- Analytics opt-in/out (GDPR-compliant)
- French and English localization

### Deliverables
- `SettingsView` in SwiftUI
- Localizable.strings files for `en` and `fr`
- Analytics module respecting opt-out

### Security & Privacy
- Do not log PII or sensitive settings
- Encrypt analytics payload in transit
- Provide clear privacy policy links

---

## Phase 7: Analytics, GDPR & Crash Reporting (1 week)

### Features
- Integrate privacy-first analytics SDK
- GDPR opt-in consent banner
- Crash reporting via a secure service (e.g., Sentry)

### Deliverables
- Consent UI and state management
- Analytics event schema (minimal PII)
- Crash report integration with stripped stack traces

### Security Tasks
- Ensure analytics endpoint uses TLS 1.2+
- Mask any user identifiers
- Log only app errors, no PII

---

## Phase 8: Polishing, Accessibility & Testing (2 weeks)

### Goals
- Implement VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type support
- Add UI tests for critical flows (auth, mixer, downloads)
- Performance profiling (launch time, audio latency)
- Security audit and penetration testing checklist

### Deliverables
- Full test coverage report (>80% critical paths)
- Accessibility audit report
- Dependency vulnerability scan and remediation

---

## Phase 9: Beta Release & Feedback (2 weeks)

### Goals
- Distribute via TestFlight
- Gather user feedback and crash logs
- Triage and fix critical bugs

### Deliverables
- Release notes, user survey form
- Updated builds and bug‐fix patches

---

## Phase 10: Launch Preparation & App Store Submission (1 week)

### Goals
- Finalize App Store metadata and screenshots
- Perform security checklist: remove debug flags, ensure secure configurations
- Submit for review and monitor status

### Deliverables
- App Store Connect submission
- Post-launch monitoring plan (crash, analytics)

---

# Ongoing Maintenance & Security

- **Dependency Updates:** Monthly SCA and lockfile refresh
- **CI/CD:** Automated security scans on each PR
- **Monitoring:** Crash reporting dashboard, performance metrics
- **Privacy:** Annual GDPR compliance review
- **Incident Response:** Documented process for vulnerabilities

---

By following this phased plan with embedded security tasks and QA milestones, we’ll deliver a robust, performant, and secure Relaxing App aligned with user needs and regulatory requirements.
